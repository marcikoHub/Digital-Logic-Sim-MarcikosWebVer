This is a simple digital logic simulator, which I created as part of my video series: [Exploring How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0dPhqVsKt1Ni_46ARyiCGSq).

You can find the latest windows/mac/linux builds over [here](https://sebastian.itch.io/digital-logic-sim).<br>
If you want to make modifications to the program, you should open the source files in the [Unity engine](https://unity.com/).

Please note that I won't be accepting pull requests at the moment, but you're welcome to create your own fork of the project, or contribute to some of the awesome [community versions](https://github.com/SebLague/Misc-Project-Info/blob/main/Digital-Logic-Sim/Community%20Versions.md). If you plan on distributing your version, please make sure that it's following these [guidelines](https://github.com/SebLague/Misc-Project-Info/blob/main/Digital-Logic-Sim/Fork%20Guidelines.md).
